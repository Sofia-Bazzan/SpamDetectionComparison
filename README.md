# Spam Detection Project  

This repository contains the work for our project focused on **email spam detection** using the Spambase dataset. The project was developed as part of the **Statistical Learning** course and was a collaborative effort between myself and my colleague.  

## Overview  

The objective of this project is to explore various **binary classification models** to determine their effectiveness in identifying spam emails. The Spambase dataset, which includes information about word frequencies, character counts, and other email attributes, was used as the basis for our analysis.  

## Goals  

1. To implement and compare different binary classification techniques.  
2. To evaluate the predictive performance of these methods.  
3. To investigate the role of high-frequency words in identifying spam content.  

## Models Implemented  

The following classification models were explored:  

- **Logistic Regression** (with shrinkage techniques).  
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**.  
- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**.  
- **Naive Bayes**.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.  

## Key Insights  

- Examined the effectiveness of each model in detecting spam emails.  
- Highlighted the importance of specific features in classification accuracy.  
- Provided a comparative analysis of model performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.  

## Dataset  

The project uses the **Spambase dataset**, which is publicly available and contains:  
- Attributes derived from email content (e.g., word frequencies, punctuation counts).  
- A binary classification label indicating whether an email is spam (`1`) or not (`0`).  

## Structure of the Repository  

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (if permissible to share).  
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with code and analysis for each model.  
- `results/`: Performance metrics and visualizations.
