# Dataset

Our dataset, referred to as the **Spambase dataset**, comprises 4,601 instances representing individual email messages. Each instance is characterized by 57 attributes extracted from the email content, and it is accompanied by a label indicating whether it is classified as spam or non-spam.

This dataset was meticulously curated by the researchers at Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto, California. These researchers acknowledged the escalating issue of email spam during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Recognizing the necessity for accurate and efficient approaches to automatically differentiate spam emails from legitimate ones, they undertook the task of assembling a dataset that covered a diverse array of email messages, encompassing both spam and non-spam. Furthermore, they extracted relevant features from these messages to aid in the development and assessment of such methods.
